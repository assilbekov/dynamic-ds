Here's a hint for developers that makes the app feel better.

When picking a loading state the current industry choice is a Skeleton. But if you expect your API response time to be low then that'll feel slow.

---

**Skeleton** - Good for slow loads (2+ seconds). For quick loads (<2s), it makes your app feel slower than it is. Also use for an unknown content.

**Spinner** - Fast to build, bad UX. Fine for prototyping.

**Blur + Light Skeletons** - Keep labels visible, blur values, light skeletons for badges. Perfect for dashboards and quick updates.
